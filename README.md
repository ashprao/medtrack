# MedTrack: An AI Pair Programming Experiment

## The Experiment

This project represents a unique experiment in AI pair programming, where I built a complete medication tracking application without writing a single line of code manually. Every aspect of development was handled through natural language interaction with Claude (claude-3.5-sonnet) via the Cline extension in VSCode.

### The Goal
Could we create a fully functional, production-quality application solely through AI programming? I chose Go and Fyne UI as the foundation, and let the AI handle everything else - from suggesting SQLite for storage to implementing a clean MVC architecture.

### Key Findings

üåü **What Worked Well**
1. **Complete Automation**
   - AI suggested architectural patterns
   - Cline handled all file operations
   - Automated testing and debugging
   - Generated comprehensive documentation

2. **Sophisticated Debugging**
   - When the medication listing broke, Claude showed impressive adaptability
   - Evolved from static code analysis to strategic logging
   - Successfully diagnosed and fixed complex issues

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Challenges**
The most significant insight came from UI state management issues:
- Forms would break 3-4 times during development
- Each regression triggered multiple AI fix attempts
- While initial development was lightning fast...
- Repeated fixes consumed significant credits
- Time savings were partially offset by regression cycles

This revealed a crucial trade-off: AI's rapid initial development can be offset by recurring issues and credit consumption from repeated fix attempts.

## Looking Forward

While this experiment proved AI-only development is possible, it highlighted both potential and limitations. Success requires smart decisions about when to let AI iterate versus stepping in manually. The future of development might look like this - but with better handling of UI state and more refined AI interaction strategies.
